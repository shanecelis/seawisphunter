I had an idea for applying the Bitcoin Open Assets to create
Transferable Software Licenses.  I tweeted about it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>2/ The private key is their license key. Unguarded sharing of this key is unwise since it can be transferred by any key holder. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash">#Bitcoin</a></p>&mdash; Shane Celis (@shanecelis) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanecelis/status/547676730178437120">December 24, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>4/ It looks like the old licensing system but it can&#39;t be counterfeit. It&#39;s transferable &amp; piracy requires a conspiracy of thieves. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash">#bitcoin</a></p>&mdash; Shane Celis (@shanecelis) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanecelis/status/547678361062244352">December 24, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[Elaine Young](https://twitter.com/ejyoung67) asked for clarification,
so I spent a little time trying to create some images that described
the transferable software license idea and its two building blocks:
Bitcoin and Open Assets.  The images may be a little easier to
[view on tumblr](http://shanecelis.tumblr.com/post/106548802602).
(Images made in [Paper 53](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper).)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Transferable software license with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash">#bitcoin</a> open assets in three infographics. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inonetweet?src=hash">#inonetweet</a> <a href="http://t.co/GyUzKZQoCO">pic.twitter.com/GyUzKZQoCO</a></p>&mdash; Shane Celis (@shanecelis) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanecelis/status/547896416254033920">December 24, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This video is the final form of me trying to explain an application of
open assets.  Transferable Software Licenses is probably a dull albeit
lucrative application.  The real point though is that these assets
could be used for anything!  It could be concert tickets, in-game
currency, or quadrapuses.
