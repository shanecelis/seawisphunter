<a href="/img/graphcraft-example.png"><img src="/img/graphcraft-example.png" style="float:right;" width="300px"></a>I released [GraphCraft](http://seawisphunter.com/product/2015/01/06/graphcraft/) to the [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/content/seawisp-hunter-llc/graph-craft/b1o) this week!  To
prepare for that, wrote up some docs, and I made a video.  Not like
one of my usual videos which are a couple minutes.  No, I took some
[advice](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/10/21/the-10-commandments-of-asset-promotion/) that suggested 30 seconds.  Thirty seconds is crazy to me!
Conceiving of [a 30 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7MYfArhqr0) to show what GraphCraft does was
challenging, but hopefully it works.

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/T1qqfaD.jpg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/T1qqfaD.jpg" width="300px" style="float: right;"></a>In other news I built a [Planck Keyboard](http://planckkeyboard.com).  This is a 40% keyboard.
My daily driver has been a [Poker II](http://www.vendio.com/stores/E-sports-Gaming-equipments/item/shop-mechanical-keyboard-by-br/kbc-poker-2-61keys-mechanical-/lid=35050923), which is a 60% keyboard
meaning that it has no numpad, no arrow keys, no function keys.  Most
of those keys are still accessible. For instance the `F1` key is
produced by hitting the `Fn` key and `1`. The 40% keyboard goes even
further and has no dedicated number keys. The compact keyboard keeps your fingers close to home row though.

One of the most tantalizing aspects of building my own keyboard was
getting to write the firmware!  This allows you to make up your own
layout without any restrictions or limitations.  Here are a
[few layouts](https://github.com/pcarrier/planck) for the Planck
keyboard.  I made
[my own layout](https://gist.github.com/shanecelis/ba44ce4b21b62aeeb018).
The space-bar keyboard swap code is available on my
[tmk_keyboard](https://github.com/shanecelis/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/planck)
fork on github.  I also cleaned up the codebase so it doesn't rely on
gh60 anymore.  It has its own directory since it's its own keyboard.
I have been experiencing a little analysis paralysis having the
freedom to change the keyboard layout. Little annoyances leave me
considering, "What if I changed to layout to fix that? But that would
make this part more annoying...."  With great freedom comes great
urges to use that freedom.

So I released something virtual! And I made something physical! Shane
does it all now!
