For this session of [Vermont Game Developers](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/), we had two tech tutorials and two show-and-tells.  Here is [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2TlaR4A3g4) and some highlights.

* [Talk 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2TlaR4A3g4): Aaron Morton demonstrates how to use Unity animations to make your user interfaces pop!

* [Talk 2](https://youtu.be/K2TlaR4A3g4?t=19m18s): Jeff Sprenger shows how to use Rhino 3D to do some 3D modeling.  It's very different from the modeling I'm used to with a big emphasis on math and curves.

* [Show and tell (slot 1)](https://youtu.be/K2TlaR4A3g4?t=54m24s): Magic wand demo by me, Shane Celis.

* [Show and tell (slot 2)](https://youtu.be/K2TlaR4A3g4?t=1h8s): Pizza Underground by Scott Ethington
and Phil Wellheuser.

* Show and tell (slot 3): Unfilled.

* Show and tell (slot 4): Ran out of time.

If you have a talk idea, please feel free to email me (shane.celis at gmail.com) and Jeff (jeff at xemory.com). We're trying to get one step of ahead of the next meeting.

And here's [a link](/vtgd/2015/06/08/vermont-game-developers-2-how-to-thrive-as-an-independent-studio/) to the previous talk by Marguerite Dibble.
