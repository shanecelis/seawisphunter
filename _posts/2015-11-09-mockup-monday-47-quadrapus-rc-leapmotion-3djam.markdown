For this Mockup Monday I'm showing you [Quadrapus RC](http://shanecelis.itch.io/quadrapusrc); it's my entry to the [LeapMotion 3D Jam 2015](https://itch.io/jam/leapmotion3djam).  RC stands for remote control and it's [free to download](http://shanecelis.itch.io/quadrapusrc).  By itself, it's a toy that allows you to control a virtual four-legged robot.  With a real four-legged robot, it can serve as a remote control.  I'm using my [Sunfounder Crawling Quadruped Robot](http://www.sunfounder.com/index.php?c=showcs&id=99&model=Crawling%20Quadruped%20Robot).  I [modified some of Sunfounder's code](https://gist.github.com/shanecelis/7d058da7a361cce10bda) that has been generously released under the GPLv3.

If you have some fun with this, I'd love to see a picture or video on twitter [@shanecelis](http://twitter.com/shanecelis).
