I implemented a new control scheme in Quadrapus Sumo using the palm
orientation as the player's means of indicating what direction they
generally want to go in.  The player's fingers still map one-to-one to
the quadrapuses legs.  Indicating the desired direction does not by
itself initiate motion by itself; one still has to use their
fingers---that is their quadrapus' legs---to move, which I like.  I'd
like to achieve something using the
[Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) controller that can't be done
with a conventional controller.

To make it clear to the user that their palm orientation has this
effect, I need to communicate that visually and with regularity.
Initially, I was going to just show an arrow below the hand.  I was
implementing this while
[streaming on twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/shanecelis/profile) and
someone in the stream suggested a banana or some other desired object
(e.g., spider, potato) being held on a stick in front of the
quadrapus, so I went with that since it seemed more fun.  The benefit
of this is that the visual feedback is immediate and regular even if
the motion of the quadrapus is not.

I'll be
[streaming an "Ask a #gamedev" session today on twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/shanecelis/profile),
so if you're interested in game development, robots, Unity3D, Leap
Motion, or physics, feel free to pop in and ask me a question.
