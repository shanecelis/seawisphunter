This week I focused on refactoring [Quadrapus Sumo](http://seawisphunter.com/product/2015/02/09/quadrapus-sumo/) such that I could easily load new characters.  One problem, I only had two characters that were the exact same except for their color.  So I made some more.

* Mr. Red is the original quadrapus uniform and symmetric.  He's Mario in Super Mario Cart.

<a href="/img/mr-blue.gif"><img src="/img/mr-blue-small.gif" style="" width="200px"></a>

* Mr. Blue has a crab-like appearance with large forelegs and smaller hindlegs. For some reason his left eye is kind of wonky, right now.

<a href="/img/dr-green.gif"><img src="/img/dr-green-small.gif" style="float:right;" width="200px"></a>

* Dr. Green was an attempt to do a frog with large hindlegs but it may have turned out more like a grasshopper.

<a href="/img/ms-orange.gif"><img src="/img/ms-orange-small.gif" style="" width="200px"></a>

* Ms. Orange was intended to be a giraffe but due to the way the joint axes were rotated it ended up looking like a squid, which I kind of like.

Next week I hope to show some new control schemes that use just two or even one finger to control a quadrapus instead of four fingers.
