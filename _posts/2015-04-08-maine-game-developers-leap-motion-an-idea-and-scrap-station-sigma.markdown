[Seth Pillsbury](https://twitter.com/foundtimegames) invited me to give a talk to the [Maine Game Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/280405972107121/) group.  I gave a talk on two topics: Leap Motion with a technical and market overview, an idea I had for using mini arcade cabinets for local game developers.  [Sleepy Lizard Games](https://twitter.com/SleepyLizardGam) gave a demo of his game [Scrap Station Sigma](http://www.sleepylizardgames.com/wp/); his game is on [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377660877).

Here are the video highlights:

* [April Fools](https://youtu.be/a5iFepLmVjA?t=6m10s) joke that went awesome.
* [Leap Motion](https://youtu.be/a5iFepLmVjA?t=7m13s) part of the talk
* [Quadrapus Sumo](https://youtu.be/a5iFepLmVjA?t=11m25s) demo
* The audio recording for the second part of my talk was actually too muffled to use.  Luckily, I had given this part of my talk to the Vermont Game Developers group, which [you can see here.](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=33m31s)
* [Scrap Station Sigma](https://youtu.be/a5iFepLmVjA?t=28m09s) demo

Thanks again for hosting this talk, [Maine Game Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/280405972107121/) group and [Seth Pillsbury](https://twitter.com/foundtimegames), who I should say has recently finished his game [Jumpsmith](http://jumpsmithgame.com) also on [Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=398428082).
