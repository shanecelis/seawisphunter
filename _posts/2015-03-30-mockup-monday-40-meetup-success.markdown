Just a little recap of my experience at the first [Vermont Game
Developers](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/) meetup.  Here is [a video of the talk, slides, and highlights](http://seawisphunter.com/vtgd/2015/03/28/vermont-game-developers-1-introduction-and-mini-arcade-cabinet/).  The next meetup is scheduled.  [Please RSVP for Marguerite Dibble's talk](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/221463737/) about what it means to start an indie game studio.

I was tempted to share a mockup in this post, but it would merely recapitulate what I said during [my last talk](http://seawisphunter.com/vtgd/2015/03/28/vermont-game-developers-1-introduction-and-mini-arcade-cabinet/), which I have video for and a direct link to that portion of the talk.  So if you're hungry for a mockup, [here it is!](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=33m33s)
