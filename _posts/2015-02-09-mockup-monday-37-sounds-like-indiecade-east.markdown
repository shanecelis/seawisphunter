I'm attending [Indiecade East](http://www.indiecade.com/east_2015/)
this weekend. It's an independent game developer conference in New
York at the Museum of the Moving Image.  I'll be showing
[Quadrapus Sumo on Saturday, February 14th, 11am to 1 pm](http://sched.co/2FNI),
so please come by.

I'd love to chat with you about my game, your game, game development,
and game design in general.  I'm also very interested in meeting
low-poly artists, musicians, and sound designers as I may be
commissioning work soon (no rev share; I will pay you for your work).
Also please feel free pick my brain on in going full procedural
generation by using evolutionary robotics techniques rather than
traditional animation, in what I'd call robogamedev.

In this episode I showcase the addition of sound effects, voice, and
background music.  The sound effects are from the
[Universal Sound FX](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17256)
asset on the Unity Store, which has so far lived up to its name.  For
announcements, I recorded my voice using my best Street Fighter II
imitation using [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net).  For the
background music, I used
[incompetech's royalty free music archive](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?feels%5B%5D=Intense).
The music here often requires attribution, but it is otherwise
royalty-free.  For instance, the music I used in my level is
["Scattershot" by Kevin MacLeod](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100776)
