This Mockup Monday is an introduction and tutorial to GraphCraft, an
asset that will be released for the
[Unity3D Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com) shortly.
GraphCraft uses graphs constituted by vertices and edges to construct
recursively-describable bodies.  For instance, this "snake" is made by
one vertex and one edge.  The edge's position, scale, and rotation are
applied recursively in its construction.

Here is an example scene included in the asset.  The construction and
preview rows differ because the tree, quadrapus, and humanoid all have
rigid bodies and joints.

This encoding was inspired in part by
[Karl Sims' genetic encoding](http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf);
however, GraphCraft is intended for human designers to create
recursive/fractal bodies.
