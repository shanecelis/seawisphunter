In this Mockup Monday, I discuss how to fix the Quadrapus Sumo
control, which is currently broken for two players.  I added jetpacks
which help immensely for single player mode, but when two players face
off against each other, they fight to interact in the same space often
occluding one another's hands.  My plan is to have the orientation of
the hand indicate what direction the user wants to go and give the
quadrapus a consistent "push" in that direction.  Not so much of a
push that it causes the quadrapus to drift against friction, but
enough that when the legs are pitter-patter on the ground, the push
will help the quadrapus move in the direction the user intends.
Fixing the location of the hand on the display would also help to
inform the user that waving your hand around doesn't matter.

The world of streaming has become interesting for game developers.
Twitch recently added a
[Game Development](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Game%20Development)
channel.  I've streamed a couple times now.  It's a great way to
panopticon yourself into working.  You're always being watched.  You
can't subconsciously open up that Facebook tab and zone out.  You're
expected to be working.  It's funny because if a boss were to ever
expect me to share my desktop with him so he could see whether I was
working anytime he wanted, I'd never tolerate such a thing.  However,
now that I'm my own boss, I've come to find that I'm the worst boss
ever.  If you're interested in seeing me stream,

A word of caution for would-be streamers:
[Tidy up your virtual desktop AND your real desktop lest you leave something embarrassing around.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpo6BixENiM)

When I did stream, I got a number of questions from people asking
about their own games.  It seems like there is a real desire for
people to learn how to express themselves in the game medium and
programming often tends to be one of the biggest initial hurdles.  So
I did an "Ask a #gamedev" stream dedicated to answering people's
questions.  (You can see the
[broadcast here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFwBmXZm4rw&feature=youtube_gdata).)
I got questions like:

* What book do you recommend for learning Unity?
* How do you transition from robotics research to game development?
* Any advice on designing simple 2D physics systems?
* Are you participating in [ludum dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/)
in December?
* Do I need to learn heavy geometry in order to program in 3D?
* How much long of experience do I need from transitioning over 2D to
3D?
* Do you have any projects you can show and demonstrate for us?

It felt good to be able to provide a service for people interested in
creating their own games.  But I also learned about some things that
being immersed in evolutionary robotics research that I would have
already known like this TV show.

One person in the stream brought up a fascinating UK show that
featured an augmented-reality virtual robot building and battling TV
show called [Bamzooki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamzooki), which I
had never heard of before.  It aired from 2004 to 2010, and I can't
believe this existed.
[See it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqV9N7RIRjU) and
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbUYyWZ_xK8#t=374). The robots,
construction, and physics look sophisticated.  The have
[software available for download](http://bamzooki-sr.software.informer.com)
that anyone with Windows can play with and create new robot
morphologies or shapes.  I'm still really intrigued to try and
discover where exactly the smoke-and-mirrors are hidden, and who or
what technical team of people was behind its production.

Streaming is a pretty exciting for game developers.  It's an exciting
time to be a gamedev.
