My first live-recorded Mockup Monday!

Little back story to this mockup: My wife and I went to [The Wizarding World](https://www.universalorlando.com/harrypotter/) at Universal Studios in Florida.  We picked up some of their awesome collectible wands.  Unfortunately there is only one place on Earth that you can actually _use_ these wands.  Until now.  [Watch me demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZRL8mRxLAE) some spell casting with a wand using a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com).

For those interested in how I'm doing the spell detection, lereâ€™s the [Unistroke library][1] I used.  [Their paper][2] on it is actually very readable.  There are plenty of implementations of the library for other languages but none for Unity, so I wrote one.  I may release it as an asset.  [Ping me][4] if you're interested in a prerelease.

I've done some [other work][3], Emacs for iPhone, using that unistroke library, but have yet to put the polish into releasing that.
