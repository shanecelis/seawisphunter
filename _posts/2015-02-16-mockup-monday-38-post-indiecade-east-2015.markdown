I went to [IndieCade East](http://www.indiecade.com/east_2015/) last
weekend with [Charlie Hohn](https://twitter.com/SlowWaterMvmnt).
Charlie and I put made a flyers for ourselves.  I show some photos
from the show and tell session for [Quadrapus
Sumo](http://seawisphunter.com/product/2015/02/09/quadrapus-sumo/) in
the video above.

One of the standout pieces of technology to me was [Google
Cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/) that I saw being
used by [little wins](http://www.lilwins.com).  It turns your smart
phone into a cheap, portable VR rig.  I worry about the
inaccessibility of building on a modestly-priced device like the Leap
Motion, so this makes the prospect of building a VR application for a
large audience not unthinkable.

I met the organizer of
[Maine Game Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/280405972107121/),
[Seth Pillsbury](https://twitter.com/foundtimegames).  He runs a game
development group that meets once a month.  I picked his brain because
I've been considering starting my own group in Vermont.  I intend on
visiting to talk about developing for the Leap Motion and Quadrapus
Sumo sometime soon.

There were a lot of excellent games.  I'm just going to mention
a few that stood out to me and why in no particular order.

* [Particle Mace](http://andymakes.com/particlemace/) by [Andy Wallace](https://twitter.com/andy_makes)---Direct control of what's vulnerable, indirect control of what's offensive and lots of fun
* [Axiom Verge](http://www.axiomverge.com/trailers/) by [Tom Happ](https://twitter.com/AxiomVerge)---Metroid. Metroid. METROID.
* [8 Bitty Games](http://8bittygames.com) by [Patrick Rodriguez](https://twitter.com/LightAesthetic)---Yarn Ball was interesting to me in part because I made a game using a similar mechanic for an LDJAM called [minimaze](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2008/04/20/ld11-minimaze/) using a snowball ("Great minds...").
* [Hell Divers](http://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-ps4/)---Fun party game; has friendly fire; minigames for reviving your friends; made instant friends with strangers
* [Extreme Exorcism](http://goldenrubygames.com/games/extreme-exorcism) by [Mike Christatos](https://twitter.com/christatos) and [Andy Wallace](https://twitter.com/andy_makes)---Four player madness, lots of settings for lots of replayability
* [Exposure](http://thesheepsmeow.com/press/sheet.php?p=EXPOSURE) by [Brian Chung](http://brianschung.com/) and [GJ Lee](http://leegj.com/)---Interesting camouflage mechanic
* [Realistic Kissing Simulator](http://jimmylands.com/experiments/kissing/) by [Jimmy Andrews](https://twitter.com/auxiliaryZaphos) and [Loren Schmidt](https://twitter.com/LorenSchmidt)---Just play it. It's web based. You'll see why.
* [Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime](http://www.asteroidbase.com/dangerous-spacetime/) by [Asteroid Base](http://www.asteroidbase.com/about-us/)---It's a game that'll inspire instant bickering between you and your coplayer.

IndieCade East was a good experience for me, and it's cheap as far as
conferences go.  I would definitely recommend it to other independent
game developers.
