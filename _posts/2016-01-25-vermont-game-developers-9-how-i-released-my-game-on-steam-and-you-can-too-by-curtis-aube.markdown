For this [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/226643330/) [Curtis Aube](https://twitter.com/KetosGames) guides us through the process of releasing a game through Steam using his recent experience with [Marble Muse](http://store.steampowered.com/app/368310/). His talk covers Greenlight, SDK integration, building with SteamPipe, releasing, and handling the public response leading up to and following a game release. He shares his successes and failures throughout this process to prepare you to hopefully have a smooth, successful launch of your game on Steam.

Curtis Aube was born and raised in Vermont. He's been making games for over 16 years. He has built games on DOS, Flash, and Unity. He recently released Marble Muse. See his [website](http://ketosgames.com/) for more details, or follow him on [twitter](https://twitter.com/KetosGames) to stay in touch.
