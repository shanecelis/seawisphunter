I met with the [Vermont Gaming Community: Game Design
Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1408039082775192/) last week.
Great group!  They shared prototypes of card games, board games, dice
games and other table top games they were all personally working on.
We did some play testing of a few games. Feedback was collected, rules
were amended, and tried playing the game again to try the new rules.
It was really cool!  It made me a little envious of how quickly
variations of table top games can be iterated through.  It
strengthened my resolve to try to create a similar environment for
video game developers.

Jeff Sprenger and I started a [meetup
group](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/) for local video
game developers in Vermont.  Jeff's making an evolutionary robotics
based game [Neurobotik](http://www.xemory.com).  I'm making [Quadrapus
Sumo](http://seawisphunter.com/product/2015/02/09/quadrapus-sumo/).
We're having our first meeting on [Thursday, March 26th at 6:30
PM](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/220875995/)
at Farrell Hall.  We plan on hosting a monthly meeting for people to
give talks or show-and-tells.

The talks can be on whatever game development related topic you like.
Have a new technology or app in your tool belt that you want to share?
Tell us about it!  Making a game that's driving you insane because
you're not sure it's fun yet?  Tell us about that too.  Maybe someone will
share an idea that alters your perspective.  Suggest a talk that
you'd like to give, or just suggest a talk that you'd like to hear.

Show-and-tells let many local developers to
show off their game in its current state, whatever state that is.  It
can be beta, alpha, or super alpha.  Just show us what you've been working on!
Get feedback from other game designers.  Your programmer art will not
be held against you (but you might meet an artist that gets what
you're trying to do).

So please consider coming out and joining us on March 26th for our [first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/220875995/)!
