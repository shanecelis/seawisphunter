We had our first very successful [Vermont Game Developers](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/) meetup!  I was really impressed by the turnout.  I think it was thirty plus.  We had initially hoped for twelve-ish.

[A video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avEVj3BNGGs) is available on youtube.  Here are the [slides for my talk](/img/Vermont Game Developers 1.pdf).  Some highlights:

* [Jeff Sprenger](https://twitter.com/Neurobotik) responds to my [introduction of him as my co-host, **nemesis**, and friend.](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=2m1s)

* [Charlie Hohn](https://twitter.com/SlowWaterMvmnt) introduces himself and [his love-hate relationship with Minecraft](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=11m1s)

* [Goals for the group](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=20m59s)

* [Meeting format](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=24m47s)

* Vermonters' love their locally made food and art. [Why not locally made video games?](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=33m33s) Thus my idea for a Mini Arcade Cabinet to showcase locally made games.

* [Show and tell (slot 1):](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=49m25s) my game [Quadrapus Sumo](http://seawisphunter.com/product/2015/02/09/quadrapus-sumo/)

* [Show and tell (slot 2):](https://youtu.be/avEVj3BNGGs?t=52m52s) Jeff and Aaron's game

In the future, we'll aim to have four 5-minute show-and-tell slots available on a first-come first-serve basis.  This is your chance to share what you're working on with the group or a cool tool you've found.

Some really good ideas were brought up during the meeting.  Here are a few that probably should be followed up on:

* [What discussion platform should we use?](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/messages/boards/thread/48832783)
  Thank you Aaron for starting the discussion.  I'll post my thoughts there.

* Orson suggested hosting a public demo day perhaps once a quarter. [I started a discussion on it.](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/messages/boards/thread/48834591/#127882902)

Our [next Vermont Game Developers meetup has been scheduled](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/221463737/).  [Marguerite Dibble](http://birnamwoodgames.com/Personal%20Site/about.html) will be speaking about starting an indie game studio!  [Please RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/Vermont-Game-Developers/events/221463737/) so we'll know whether we ought to seek a bigger venue.  Farrell Hall seemed adequate for the talk but mingling was a little cramped.  Great to meet everyone!
