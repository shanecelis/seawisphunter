Control your red four-legged friend with your hand using the
[Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com).  The red quadrapus' legs
mimic the actions of your fingers.  Compete against your friends or
evolved quadrapuses in a sumo-like/king-of-the-hill arena.  Don't fall
off the edge.  This is another prototype in what I'm calling
robogamedev which emphasizes robotics techniques over handcrafted
animation.
